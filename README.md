Computer Vision applied to online chess

Academic project done in cooperation with Lucas Fayolle, former classmate.

Computer Vision was applied in order to tell an external AI the position of the pieces on an virtual chessboard. It would then pick the best move and play it. More details can be found in the report (language: French).
